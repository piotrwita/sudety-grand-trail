        "title": "Unfortunate start",
        "content": "Just before 1:00 AM, I arrived in Jarnołtówek. This is the town where this trail begins. Right next to the roundabout, I found a marker with a yellow dot defining the start of my adventure. I needed a moment to prepare myself for the start, and when I did, a few minutes after 1:00, I set off on an uncharted Sudeten trail.\n\nI immediately began slowly climbing towards Biskupia Kopa. This is the first peak on my route, and also the highest peak of the Opawskie Mountains on the Polish side.\n\nEntering the forest, it immediately became dark around me. I feel moisture in the air, as it had rained quite heavily here not long ago. Fortunately, it's relatively dry now, and only when brushing against leaves do drops of water fall on me. I also noticed that it's relatively warm for nighttime, and I feel complete thermal comfort.\n\nBefore 3:00, after briefly wandering in the dark forest, I managed to conquer my first peak. The observation tower on Biskupia Kopa was closed, so there are no views here at this hour. I was hoping to see at least a glimpse of sunrise, but I'm definitely too early. I decided not to stay long and moved on, thus crossing to the Czech side, where I'll spend the next few days.\n\nBefore 4:00, I reached the town of Zlaté Hory. It's already starting to dawn here, so I turn off my headlamp. I won't need it anymore now, and I need to save batteries for the further days of hiking. From here, I can already see my next peak in the distance, Mount Příčný vrch. During the ascent, it finally starts getting light. In the distance, I see that the light on Biskupia Kopa tower has already gone out. Amazing views emerged around me. The vast space allows me to feel true excitement. Between the sky shrouded in a thick layer of clouds and the horizon, there's a delicate gap through which the glow of the rising and fiery red sun begins to reach me.\n\nDescending from the peak, I passed a roadside well. Two glass cups were placed on it. I assumed this meant the water was safe to drink. I stopped for a moment to drink several solid portions. I love such places where I can hydrate without carrying that weight.\n\nI continued on, descending to a small village, where a long section awaits me now - the ascent to today's highest mountain. This is Praděd, measuring exactly 1491 meters above sea level. Having just lost significant altitude, I'll now have to work hard to achieve this goal.\n\nA bit further, an unpleasant surprise awaited me. As I walked along a forest road, it suddenly turned out that a river crossed my route. This wouldn't be strange if not for the fact that the bridge that enabled crossing to the other side was washed away. I had to improvise and noticed stones set up a bit further. They were relatively stable, though some wobbled slightly. Despite everything, I decided to risk it and managed to cross the river with dry feet.\n\nWhen I set my course for the next peak, I began to feel the effects of the sleepless night. Around 8:00, I decided I needed to sleep for a while, so I took off my backpack and lay down on the forest floor under conifers. I fell asleep in the blink of an eye, and my nap lasted less than half an hour. After that time, I felt much better.\n\nA bit further, when I reached a trail intersection, I saw a large group of people heading in the same direction as me. At first, I thought they were just weekend tourists. However, I quickly learned that a hiking rally was underway.\n\nI joined the group of people, which allowed me to adjust my pace as I wanted. This really helped me find my rhythm.\n\nAfter a while, it turned out there weren't only Czechs here. A Pole approached me and began telling me his mountain stories. At one point, he started talking about his long-distance adventure, then mentioned a mysterious person who wants to hike 900 kilometers through the Sudetes.\n\nWhat a surprise when it turned out that someone completely unknown to me was following my activities. We talked for the next few hours, the kilometers flew by in the blink of an eye. Meanwhile, it also started raining a bit and the wind picked up. Overall, it got much colder. We conquered together the worst ascent of today, then parted ways at the Švýcárna shelter.\n\nBefore 13:00, I left the shelter where I spent about a quarter of an hour replenishing energy. Now only the ascent to the peak lay ahead. It didn't seem difficult, but in a few moments, everything around was covered in a thick layer of clouds. It started blowing very hard and raining a bit. I quickly felt cold on my body and wanted to reach the destination as soon as possible. Finally frozen, I reached the building at the summit. It took me a moment to recover, and when I did, I put on my jacket and continued.\n\nUnfortunately, the weather didn't want to change. For over three hours, I had to walk in such conditions. Visibility was almost zero, and with each step, my body's comfort decreased. My hands were completely frozen from the cold. Additionally, fatigue from lack of sleep made me increasingly drowsy. Walking along the ridge of the massif, suddenly, as if touched by a magic wand, the clouds cleared. Only around 17:00 did it stop raining, but the wind didn't stop. I was completely soaked and frozen.\n\nOver time, as I began to lose altitude, it started getting a bit warmer. At one point, the sun even came out briefly from behind the clouds. This event evoked great optimism in me. I also passed another spring, so I hydrated a bit.\n\nJust before 19:00, I descended to the city of Rýmařov. Just beyond it, I plan today's overnight stay. There's nothing interesting here except a typical center, so I pass through without much interest. However, I'll remember that it's starting to rain again, and the sky is completely cloudy.\n\nAdditionally, today's overnight stay offers doubtful protection from rain. Well, I'll risk it and at worst improvise if I have a problem.\n\nAt 20:30, I reach the previously mentioned shelter. Though I'd rather call it an ordinary bench with a leaky roof. Additionally, the surface is terribly narrow. There was nothing better in the area, so I'm happy with it and not complaining. I also decided not to sleep in my sleeping bag, as there's simply too little space for it. I'll put on all the clothes I have and maybe somehow survive the night.\n\nI'll eat a small dinner and go to sleep. Goodnight."

        "title": "Even more rain",
        "content": "It was definitely not a good idea not to take out my sleeping bag for the night. A moment after I lay down, I already knew this and quickly changed my decision. That was a very smart move.\n\nUnfortunately, the lack of space on the bench also significantly affected my sleep quality. Additionally, sleeping near a herd of cows also didn't help, as I woke up multiple times because of it.\n\nIt also turned out that it drizzled a few times. This makeshift roof, which I complained about so much, actually saved my skin and worked perfectly today.\n\nFinally, I got up at 3:00 and immediately started packing. Unfortunately, it was still dark, which made the task slightly difficult. After twenty minutes, I was ready and set off.\n\nThe weather today isn't treating me well again. It's been cloudy and cold since morning. Judging by what's happening in the sky, there's no chance it will change and the sun will come out. At least it's not raining - for now.\n\nToday's only and biggest goal is actually the Slunečná peak. It's located roughly in the middle of today's route. To get there, I pass through gentle surrounding forests, passing several villages along the way.\n\nAt one point, I saw a message that something was wrong with the GPS tracker. It turned out there was equipment failure, and unfortunately, my track won't be available online for now. I'm probably too far from the Polish border. I'll let you know if something gets fixed.\n\nThe further section of the trail is a comfortable asphalt road between fields. Almost no cars drive here, so it's relatively pleasant, especially since the sun isn't beating down on my head. When I'm already five kilometers before the peak, I had an idea. At this point, my route overlaps, as I need to go up and return the same way. I decided that for these ten kilometers total, I can manage without my backpack. I threw it into a nearby grove, hoping no one would find it there. Besides, honestly, who in their right mind searches for backpacks in forests?\n\nWalking lightly, I pass a Czech train station. It turns out this is an exclusive stop with modern toilets, where there are even public electrical outlets. I'm a bit sorry I left my charger in the backpack. I washed up a bit and filled my water bottle, which I felt I was a bit short on today. Fortunately, I have plenty here and can make up for the shortage.\n\nI reach the peak I was heading for at 10:30. There's a transmission station here and a small shelter with a fire pit. I looked around for a moment and, without wasting too much time, started back for my backpack.\n\nOn the way back, I couldn't do anything else but take advantage of the luxury I discovered once more. I washed up again and drank lots of water.\n\nJust before noon, I reached my abandoned backpack. Fortunately, no one found it, and I can continue the journey.\n\nUnfortunately, it keeps raining, and my clothes are getting wetter and wetter. The worst thing is that my shoes are completely soaked, which my feet are increasingly feeling. There's no point in stopping to dry them, as it will be the same again soon. Besides, there's really nowhere to stop here anyway. I'll have to somehow endure this moment and wait until it's dry.\n\nWhen the approach to today's last mountain, called Lesný, awaited me, that's when the weather really broke down. Starting from a village low in the valley, I didn't even expect such a development. Entering a very intense but fairly short ascent, I heard a sudden roar. At first, I thought it was the sound of a waterfall, especially since no drops were reaching me at all at first. Only when the rain began breaking through the tree crowns did I feel how intense the precipitation was. In the blink of an eye, despite tree protection, I was completely wet. Additionally, the path turned into a river, which only intensified the feeling of wet feet. After a bit more than half an hour of heavy downpour, the rain finally stopped. From behind the fog, the sun even began shyly breaking through. I'm worried I'll blister my feet again already at this early stage of the trail.\n\nJust before five kilometers to the end of today's section, a real surprise awaited me. This attraction was waterfalls, which were also heavily agitated after such heavy rainfall.\n\nEnjoying the sound of falling water, I could also take advantage of its presence. I sat on the bank and soaked my feet. I love that feeling of relief. I also washed my socks, though I'm wondering - when are they supposed to dry when it's constantly wet.\n\nLiterally at the finish of the route, a few hundred meters before the place where I want to spend the night, it started pouring again. I feel it's even more intense than before. Dark clouds covered the entire sky. I sped up a bit to get to the shelter as quickly as possible.\n\nFinally, at 20:20, once again soaked to the bone, I reached the end of today's section. I'm shaking from cold, but first I need to dry off before reaching for my sleeping bag. After a moment, I spread it on the bench and crawl inside to warm up as quickly as possible. I quickly fall asleep."

        "content": "The night was incredibly cold for me. Admittedly, I didn't wake up as often today, but getting out of the sleeping bag in the morning required a lot of self-discipline. I didn't sleep very comfortably, as the narrow bench in the shelter meant I had to constantly be careful not to fall. I'm now wondering why I didn't actually sleep on the ground since the floor was covered with boards. We'll never know the answer to that question.\n\nWhen I felt the cold on my body, that was just the beginning, as I now had to put on cold and soaked clothes. At 3:20, frozen, I set off on the trail, warming up with each step.\n\nI noticed that I need to be more careful on the route, as in just the first two days I added 4 kilometers to the planned distance, which is a lot. This is all due to my carelessness and wandering off the marked trail.\n\nThe morning weather isn't delightful. Everything around is shrouded in raindrops, and you can feel the moist air. Looking at the sky, it doesn't look like it will change. At least it's not raining.\n\nToday's goal of my expedition is Mount Lázek, which measures 715 m above sea level. I'm heading in its direction.\n\nAround 8:00, I reach today's first attraction. These are castle ruins. I'm usually skeptical about such places, as they're often just a pile of rubble overgrown with bushes. Here it definitely presented itself better. Remains of turrets and walls were fantastically displayed against the Sudeten landscape.\n\nNow I have several kilometers of walking on asphalt to a larger town, Zábřeh. Walking this section, I feel how the mountains envelop me from both the right and left sides. I admire the local terrain formation, watching how folds massively rise from seemingly flat terrain. They're completely forested.\n\nJust after 10:00, I reach the city, where I plan to visit the first store on this route.\n\nI went in and shopped thoroughly. I ate cottage cheese so fatty I almost choked, it wouldn't go down my throat. I stuffed myself with bananas and nuts, drank lots of water, and was ready, full of energy to head to the goal mentioned at the beginning of the report. About 16 kilometers separate me from that peak. I should be there around 15:00.\n\nLeaving the city and walking through fields, I came across a tree completely covered in red fruits. It was an incredibly robust cherry tree. I couldn't pass indifferently by such a phenomenon. Fruit trees on trails are a wonderful addition that always boosts morale.\n\nLike a little child, I enjoyed those few minutes I spent there. Even though I was full after the break, I picked several pieces, savoring them for several more minutes of walking, popping them into my mouth one after another.\n\nMeanwhile, the weather improved somewhat. The second part of the day looks really optimistic. The sun even came out, so I finally decided to take off my sweatshirt - the first time on this expedition. Finally, I feel the lightness that accompanies such summer trips.\n\nI also noticed that the socks drying on my backpack are already dry. I can't believe it, but it's incredibly good news. Passing a stream, I washed one pair and put on fresh ones, which gave me an immediate energy boost.\n\nBefore reaching the goal, I tried to revive my GPS tracker. I got information to try cleaning the card inside, but it's carefully secured with screws. Unfortunately, my minimalist equipment didn't include bringing such tools.\n\nPassing through some village where there were practically no people, suddenly in one of the last houses someone moved. I called out asking for help. I explained the problem, and the residents managed to find the screwdriver I was looking for. I told them a bit about myself, and they also treated me to a mug of cold beer, which I didn't want. Although the old, good mountain rule says you never refuse free calories. I drank the entire contents in one gulp. I thanked them for their help and continued on my way. Unfortunately, as it turned out, my rescue action didn't bring any results, so my track remains frozen.\n\nFinally, just after 16:00, I reach the main peak of today. Unfortunately, everything here is closed behind a gate. So I only sat for a moment on a bench to recover before the final stage.\n\nContinuing on, I could finally see what I had been waiting for basically from the beginning. Beautiful vast areas surrounded by mountains, and with the accompaniment of sunny weather. Such views always take your breath away. I'm so happy to be here.\n\nAfter a solidly lengthening finish, I only reach the destination at 21:30. Today I'll sleep in Partyzánské bunkry Čečel. I must admit, somewhat war-like atmosphere, but fortunately my shelter doesn't belong to them.\n\nI don't have strength for much anymore. I just spread things on benches and my sleeping bag on the table. This is well-deserved time for a bit of recovery."

        "content": "This was definitely the coldest night so far. Already in the evening, entering the sleeping bag, I knew it would be like this, when I felt great relief just from being in it. In the morning, when the alarm rang, I felt I didn't want to get out of it for anything in the world. I had thoughts in my head that I would give a lot to be able to wait until it gets warmer.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't allow myself any indulgence in this regard, especially knowing I would have to spend a good several hours here for it to do anything at all.\n\nFinally, I pulled myself together and started packing. After a moment, my teeth began chattering from the cold. I quickly put on my backpack, counting on warming up a bit while walking.\n\nHowever, my hopes were quickly dashed by reality, and my hands became even more frozen. It was really very unpleasant walking, step by step, waiting only for the sun to finally start breaking through the trees.\n\nBut I had to wait a long time for that, as when I set off it was still dark.\n\nOnly after more than an hour of hiking, somewhere behind a thick layer of trees, I saw a great red ball. I regretted so much at that moment that I wasn't at some viewpoint. Today's sunrise must have been really impressive.\n\nFinally, I reached a crossroads where a three-kilometer detour to the peak awaited me. I left my backpack, not even really hiding it anywhere. At this hour, after all, no one will come here.\n\nI reach Mount Jelení after 5:00. This is another special point marked on my map. Unfortunately, there's nothing groundbreaking here, just an ordinary signboard in the middle of the forest. However, there's a box with a notebook, so I decided to take advantage of the opportunity and sign in.\n\nNothing else keeps me here, so I'm already going back for my backpack, then to descend to a nearby town where I plan to have breakfast.\n\nIn a small village, I stopped at a bus stop and began devouring my supplies. I also creamed my knees and ankles. Now I was ready for the next stage of the route.\n\nThrough several hours of continuous, laborious ascent, I head towards the town of Staré Město.\n\nThere's a store here where I want to fuel up before tackling the final goals of today. These are as many as three peaks located close to each other, each having some significance for this expedition.\n\nMeanwhile, before I reached the city, I pass a swift stream. I was very happy to see it, as there was very easy access to water. I took advantage of this opportunity to wash up a bit. I also brushed my teeth and filled my water bottle. Continuing on, I sip it progressively with pleasure.\n\nFurther on, I descend along small waterfalls, changing banks several times. I have to be very careful not to step on a loose stone and put my foot in the water. Fortunately, I succeed at this.\n\nDescending to the city through fields, I can't contain my delight. What spaces, fields, mountains, and finally blue sky are here. Everything is so natural in its simplicity, yet incredibly beautiful. Additionally, the sounds of nature, the rustle of wind, buzzing of insects, or chirping of birds. It's wonderful to finally walk through fields, not worrying about having completely wet shoes.\n\nOnly after 14:00 do I leave Staré Město. To shop here, I had to detour a bit from the trail. In a quite large supermarket, there were almost no products. I can't find my way around these Czech stores. It goes terribly chaotically for me.\n\nI sat behind a corner on a loading ramp for deliveries and ate everything I bought.\n\nNow I'm heading towards Větrov. This is a special peak in that there's a replica of the old observation tower from Śnieżnik. I've never been there, so I'm all the more curious how it presents itself. I remember my excitement when planning the trail this way. This is one of several touches I've incorporated here.\n\nJust before 16:00, after minor incidents with cows wandering on the trail, a majestic view emerges before me. This is exactly the observation tower I mentioned earlier. It made an immediate great impression on me, feeling incredibly fairy-tale-like.\n\nI'm generally not very fond of this type of tourist places, but this definitely has something. Probably because it was closed and I was completely alone there.\n\nSeveral minutes after 16:00, I reach the Papsrek shelter. I don't even stop here for a moment, continuing on to Smrk.\n\nNext, conquering Kowadło awaits me. There's such an intense concentration of attractions in this place.\n\nAt 19:30, after a several-kilometer section along the border trail, I finally return to Poland.\n\nThese were four beautiful days on Czech trails, but it's time to return to the homeland. I'm not saying goodbye to the Czech Republic yet, as I'll return here for longer in a few days.\n\nAt the very end, I pass through the town of Bielice. It was here that less than a year ago the town was cut off from the world by a flood. Looking at these devastating images, the collapsed bridge, completely ruined riverbed, it's hard to imagine what really happened here then.\n\nFinally, at 20:40, I reach my beautiful forest cabin. True luxury awaits me here, especially since there's no one here but me. I immediately go up to the attic, the entire floor just for me. Finally, I don't have to watch out not to fall off the bench. I'm incredibly happy about such small things.\n\nI spread out my bed and go to sleep."

        "title": "Time for a change",
        "content": "I got up at 3:00 as usual today. This ritual is starting to become second nature, as I'm feeling better and better about it. I slept perfectly today, primarily because I was warm. I don't think I woke up even once.\n\nAlthough I must remember from somewhere that it rained all night. Fortunately, I have a wonderful shelter thanks to which it didn't matter at all.\n\nI feel well-rested and refreshed. Taking advantage of these conditions, I decided to have breakfast before leaving. I quickly ate a few randomly selected snacks that I had in my provisions at that moment.\n\nAt 3:30 I finally set off on the trail. I looked at the sky in disbelief, but it had just stopped raining. Unthinkable luck.\n\nRight away I could feel that today, compared to yesterday, it's very warm. Additionally, I feel freshness in my legs, which are taking the first steps quite lightly. Thanks to this, my walking comfort is excellent.\n\nEverything around me is wet. Water droplets are dripping from trees. When I brush against branches, I'm immediately treated to a kind of shower. Moreover, I have to watch my step, because there's a lot of mud that's hard to avoid in the dark.\n\nAfter less than an hour of walking, I reach Rudawiec. There's a stamp here that I collect in my notebook. I noticed that on Czech peaks there's no such custom at all. There you probably can only collect them in shelters, but I didn't even go into those. I wonder if only in Poland there's such a culture, where at the peak, in a special box, there's such tangible confirmation of conquering a given mountain.\n\nMaybe stamps are too difficult to maintain, you also have to remember to replace the ink from time to time, and people probably often steal them to take home as souvenirs without thinking about others.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, on the other hand, there are plenty of notebooks for writing down your thoughts. In the long run, they create such a unique diary of a given peak.\n\nMeanwhile, it's already getting light. It's very cloudy, but atmospheric. Somehow today, for unknown reasons, I'm looking at everything optimistically, despite this unfavorable weather. Maybe this trail has finally gotten into my blood, or I'm still holding onto the effect of that wonderful night in the cabin. This is a great example of how much you can appreciate such seemingly small things. This is precisely one of the most important elements that such an expedition can teach us.\n\nNow I'm heading to the next peak, which is Śnieżnik, located 1423 meters above sea level. From a distance, I can see that it's completely engulfed in clouds, so unless some miracle happens, I can probably forget about views.\n\nExactly at 6:00, I start from the pass with a two-hour and demanding ascent. Between the trees, I see it's clearing up a bit, and even the sun is starting to peek through, casting its light on me. The clouds are very slowly dispersing, creating glimpses of blue. Maybe some view will still greet me here today.\n\nWhile climbing to the peak, I caught a signal for a moment. I used this time to add a backlogged post, as I hadn't had internet for a while. It also turned out that my GPS tracker, which stopped working on the first day in the Czech Republic, has just come back to life and is showing me on the trail again.\n\nGoing higher and higher, I reach a point where there are still beautiful views, but in a moment I'll enter the clouds. Unfortunately, Śnieżnik's peak is completely submerged in them, and it will certainly be white with fog.\n\nJust as I thought, at the very top there was nothing to see. Visibility was so low that even the observation tower was blurry up close. Moreover, it was very windy and cold, to the point that I was completely frozen, so I wanted to escape to the shelter as quickly as possible.\n\nThere I warmed up a bit, and above all, I used the bathroom to freshen up a bit. After a dozen or so active minutes, I was ready to set off towards Międzygórze.\n\nWhen I got there, unfortunately, the store I wanted to visit had been closed down. I'll have to hold out with shopping until the next town, even though I can already hear my stomach rumbling.\n\nI also pass a huge flood dam here, walking along its crest, and then with a demanding ascent I climb up to Igliczna, where I report to the summit a few minutes after 12:00.\n\nI didn't stay long here, I immediately descend with a steep descent, and now the trail leads me through an idyllic section through fields.\n\nUnfortunately, some farmer blocked the marked passage so his cows and bulls could graze in peace, so I have to look for a detour.\n\nFinally, at 14:00, I reach Wilkanów, where I take a break for food. There's a store here where I shop and sit on a bench in the center.\n\nIt takes me a moment to consume everything, but right after that I head towards Jagodna, which is my last goal on the trail today.\n\nOn the way to Spalona Pass, I'm walking with my back to the massif I just came from. Every now and then I turn around with envy, because now the peak is cloudless and there must be really epic views from it. That's how it is with time, unfortunately - even a few hours' difference gives a completely different image and thus perception of a given place.\n\nJust before the goal, I meet an older gentleman loading mysterious stones onto a wheelbarrow. I asked if I could help, but he firmly refused. I chatted with him that he has beautiful views from this place. He replied that some envy, while others sympathize with snow removal in winter. He listed and showed me all the peaks visible from his field, and also told me several war stories that took place on these lands. He spoke with such interest that it was a shame not to stay longer. Unfortunately, time is pressing and I had to say goodbye.\n\nJust before 19:00, I reach Spalona Pass. Here I leave my backpack in the bushes and go to conquer Jagodna, to return to the same place to the shelter where I plan to spend the most luxurious night of the entire expedition today.\n\nBefore 20:00, I reach the summit. There's an observation tower here, so I can make up for admiring the views that I missed this morning. I can't deny myself this and I go to the very top. I look around, absorbing the beauty of nature in solitude.\n\nThe sun is still quite high above the horizon line, so I won't wait for its sunset.\n\nAt 21:00, I return to the shelter, where I need to bathe, do laundry, and charge all my equipment. Only after I do this can I lie down. I'll sleep on the ground in the dining room."

        "content": "The night was very successful again. Especially after I finally washed myself thoroughly. A thorough wash gives such new energy, a bit like washing away the toil of previous days.\n\nIn the shelter, there was a mass of kids running around, at one point it was as loud as a beehive. Fortunately, at 22:00, when quiet hours began, the lady told everyone to go to sleep. In the blink of an eye, it became quiet. I then decided to go to the couch and spend the whole night there.\n\nThis was a very good move, because thanks to this I finally had it soft and slept much better.\n\nIn the morning, I simply got up, packed, and at 3:30 I was ready to start today's section. I grabbed the door handle and left the building.\n\nOutside it's still dark, but you can see a cloudless sky. Today will definitely be very sunny, although for now it's quite brisk.\n\nAfter a moment, I enter the forest. This is a very well-known section to me, where tall coniferous trees reign. They surround the long forest tracks here. This gives this place a characteristic atmosphere, which is especially emphasized in beautiful, sunny weather due to the contrast with the blue and sunny sky.\n\nThe trails in these regions are characterized by considerable monotony, so at one intersection instead of turning, I got distracted and went a kilometer in the wrong direction. Once again I tell myself that I can't allow myself such actions.\n\nIn the forest, it became hellishly cold. My hands became completely frozen. It's quite uncomfortable to walk because of this. Actually, with every step I feel how my hands are pulsing strongly from the cold.\n\nFinally, I emerge onto fields above Lasówka. Here the sun has already gently risen above the tree line, and the meadows are shrouded in a thick layer of fog. This gives a fairy-tale, majestic touch. I walk through grass that's so wet with dew that in the blink of an eye my shoes become completely wet. This time it doesn't really bother me, because the atmosphere here is extraordinary. You just have to experience it - morning fog combined with tall grass and rising sun gives an incredible impression.\n\nNow I'm heading to the Orlické Mountains range and the highest peak Velká Deštná, which I reached at 7:30. There's a very creative observation tower here, built relatively recently, in 2019. In such weather, of course, I didn't deny myself going up. The cloudless sky only intensified the beauty of the views I saw here.\n\nThe clouds haven't formed yet, thanks to which there's excellent visibility. I can see perfectly the entire trail that's still ahead of me, as well as the observation tower on Orlice, which is my next goal.\n\nI reach there at 10:00 and for comparison of the views you can see here, I also went up. At the same time, I found myself back on the Polish side. As I promised, this was just a quick Czech episode, and now it's time to descend to Zieleniec and visit the store there.\n\nThe selection was unfortunately quite poor, so I'm not satisfied with this break. I didn't acquire any valuable products, which may have consequences in the future.\n\nNow something I really don't like awaits me - losing the hard-earned elevation. Unfortunately, the peat bogs I'm heading towards are located much lower, so such a maneuver is necessary here.\n\nIncidentally, noon is approaching, and in such weather it's become really hot. I've almost forgotten about the morning frostbite.\n\nFurther on, I head along a rather monotonous trail to a peak called Kamienna Góra. This is several kilometers of continuous uniform movement, during which I started to feel sleepy. My head hurt to such an extent that I decided to lie down. A quarter-hour nap always does me good.\n\nWhen I woke up, I immediately went towards the previously mentioned goal. This is a slight detour from the trail to climb an extraordinary rocky terrace and in such weather and clarity admire the panorama of Polanica Zdrój.\n\nNow an ascent to the town of Huta awaits me. I already have earlier memories with this place, so I'm very happy that I'll be there soon. After more than an hour of ascent, I wasn't disappointed. Coming out of the forest onto the field, I first sat on a bench to have a bite to eat.\n\nA moment later, however, the best awaited me - wonderful vast views straight from the meadow that's here. You can see incredible shots of nearby towns practically from a bird's eye view. I highly recommend this place to everyone.\n\nFurther on, a very steep descent awaited me, and what's worse, I felt pain in my right knee. Unfortunately, with the next few steps it didn't stop, quite the opposite. I got very scared and immediately reached for the emergency knee brace. When I put it on, the pain stopped and I could calmly descend to the bottom.\n\nI hope that today, when my knee rests, everything will be better and this injury won't deepen. I'll probably put on this brace prophylactically for any larger descents in the near future.\n\nI'm just a bit afraid that at such an early stage of the journey I'm already feeling such discomfort. I hope it won't affect the coming days.\n\nDescending from the mountain now, only a passage through nearby villages awaits me. In one of them, I plan to stop at a store to replenish my water supply.\n\nThen I have to climb to today's accommodation, which is located on Mount Wapniarka. There's an observation tower there, from which I hope to make up for what I missed yesterday - the sunset, because today there are ideal conditions for it.\n\nJust as I dreamed, at 20:30 I reach the observation tower. I leave my backpack here on the first floor and quickly climb up. I quickly realize that this tower is a ruin and I'm afraid of every next step. Broken boards lie around, some rungs are torn out. As soon as I reached the last floor, I breathed a sigh of relief. This meant I made it in time. I see how the reddened sun is leaning towards the horizon. I still feast my eyes on this beautiful view until it goes too low. Then I go down lower and start preparing for sleep. A beautiful, starry night awaits."

        "content": "The night on the observation tower was very successful. First of all, I had a lot of space, so I didn't have to worry about falling off, as was the case with several other modest benches earlier. Thanks to this, I slept very well.\n\nWhen I woke up, I immediately checked the condition of my knee. At first glance it didn't hurt, but only when I stood up did I feel strong discomfort. Unfortunately, I had the worst-case scenario in my head. I started packing anyway, smeared my knee with ointment, and put on the brace.\n\nTaking the first steps, I felt a slight prick each time. Fortunately, with each subsequent movement it subsided. It got to the point that I started walking normally, feeling nothing. I'm very happy about this and I'm testing my limits further, but I have to be very careful.\n\nAfter descending from the mountain, more than a kilometer of fields awaits me, through very tall grass. At this time, this means only one thing. After just a few moments, I had completely soaked shoes. Immediately because of this, I felt how my morale dropped significantly. I just started, and already I have completely wet feet.\n\nMoreover, when I came out of the forest, it became cold, and my hands, especially my palms, became so stiff that it's hard to walk.\n\nI can't come to terms with the fact that such one short section can change things for a very long time. Moreover, several kilometers between villages on a fully paved road still await me.\n\nReaching the next town, another bad news awaits me. Here I have to cross to the other side of the river, but approaching the place where I was supposedly supposed to do this, there's only a broken street. This is probably another effect of last year's flood, which was destroyed and hasn't been repaired to this day. Looking for an alternative, I had to accept that the only way out is to go around, adding about five kilometers. This will definitely have a colossal impact on me at the end of the day today.\n\nWalking through fields, I can already see in the distance the summit of Kłodzka Góra majestically illuminated by the rays of the rising sun on the horizon line. At one point, the Bardzkie, Stołowe, and Bystrzyckie Mountains surround me. The sun rises above the trees, and I'm in complete wilderness, in the middle of nowhere, alone - having so much space around me.\n\nWhen my shoes dried a bit, I decided it was worth changing to dry socks. Unfortunately, about half an hour after that, it turned out that I'm entering fields again, where the grass reaches my knees. All my efforts were wasted, because I'm in the same situation again. Besides the enormous cold, the worst thing in these mornings is precisely this dew.\n\nHeading through villages towards my goal, I reach a very picturesque trail that gives a wonderful view not only of the surrounding mountains but above all of Kłodzko located in their center.\n\nAt 8:20, I reach a crossroads. Here I can leave my backpack, because now I'll be climbing Kłodzka Góra. I'll descend the same trail, so I don't need to take my luggage with me.\n\nAfter a pleasant climb, at 9:30 I report to the summit. Here I collect a stamp and immediately head to the observation tower, taking advantage of the fact that there's no one there. The weather is nice, so there's a good chance that some tourists will come soon. I finally went up, and from here there are wonderful views of the area. You can see perfectly all the mountain ranges surrounding the Kłodzko Basin. Impeccably clear sky only completes this beautiful, majestic view.\n\nNow it's time for the second point - finally reaching the highest peak of the Bardzkie Mountains. Walking a bit further, I reach Szeroka Góra, which is unknown to many as a peak of this range. I'm not really surprised, because there's not even a marked trail leading to it, and it's literally five minutes further.\n\nAt 11:30, I return for my backpack - I freshen up a bit and fly further to Kłodzko, to finally eat properly. Moreover, my water ran out just before entering, so I haven't drunk for a very long time and I need to make up for it.\n\nAfter just over an hour of walking, I reach Kłodzko, where my main goal is to stock up on main products for several days ahead.\n\nI quickly find a store and shop for goods that I had already planned earlier, so as not to waste much time in the store. Finding a place to rest was quite a challenge, because I had to walk almost the entire city loaded with shopping, to finally find a bench in the shade where I could relax peacefully. When I had eaten everything and organized my backpack, I set off.\n\nI'm heading towards Szczeliniec Wielki, to conquer the highest peak of the next range there. Unfortunately, since yesterday, since descending from Huta, until today until the end of the day, it's mainly asphalt with small exceptions. In weather like now - cloudless sky and heat pouring from the sky practically at noon - this is the worst option. Fortunately, there are places where roadside trees somewhat save the situation.\n\nSomehow I had to detour from the border to check off the Bardzkie Mountains, which is why this section leads this way. But it's also a nice break to wander through small villages, of which there's no shortage here in the basin. Some of them have really interesting histories.\n\nMoreover, these trails that lead through villages are really very scenic, especially at this place on the map. This comes from the fact that the entire basin is basically surrounded by mountains all around, which gives this incredible effect at such spacious locations.\n\nI've already mentioned what incredible views there are around the basin. For precisely such moments and days, with such clarity, the observation tower in Suszyna was built. You can see perfectly from it all those places that surround the basin, and today even further, because I can see, for example, Śnieżka.\n\nBut before I got here, literally just before entering, a guy with a child stopped me, who asked where I was going. I answered and somehow the topic of trails came up. I asked a bit more and it turned out that my logo seemed familiar. This really motivates me to create such concepts. We chatted for a while about our experiences, I also revealed a bit more details about this trail, and the young one was already impatient and pulling on dad, so we finally parted. For such moments it's worth doing such things, and in such an unexpected place at that.\n\nAnd if anyone's interested, on this tower, besides beautiful views, there are also outlets and you can charge your equipment. I was here briefly, but I still took advantage of this possibility.\n\nFurther on, I pass through Wambierzyce, where there's a beautiful basilica. I thought about stopping at a store here, but I still have water and I'll calmly make it to Radków.\n\nI reach there at 20:00 and replenish my water bottle. I was supposed to sleep today by the Pośna waterfalls, but due to the morning extra kilometers, I'd rather stay at Guzowata, where there's a shelter, and there I'd have to sleep on the ground. I'll see what the situation is like at the viewpoint when I pass by.\n\nUnfortunately, just as I thought, due to this place's access to parking and the weekend, people came for the sunset. Some simply want to spend the evening here by the grill. So I'm sticking with the original plan and I need to go a bit further.\n\nAt 21:00, I reach today's final place and I don't regret it one bit. I have access to water here, so I rinsed off and brushed my teeth. Thanks to this, I feel much fresher after this walk in full sun. Moreover, it's not particularly cold here at all, and the forest floor makes it soft.\n\nI get ready for sleep and fall asleep among the trees."

        "content": "Yesterday I fell asleep, I don't even remember when. The sound of the waterfall put me to sleep like that. It also had its downside, because I got up to pee three times - a record. I hate doing this at night, when you have to get out of the warm sleeping bag.\n\nStandardly at 3:00 I got up and packed my backpack, to set off on the trail twenty minutes later. The first section was already demanding, because I had to immediately climb Szczeliniec Wielki in the darkness. This is what makes such an ascent difficult - when you're not completely sure if you're going in the right direction.\n\nWhen after 4:30 I entered between the rock labyrinths at the very top, I was absolutely convinced that the whole show was already over. I'm talking, of course, about the sunrise on one of the viewing balconies. What a surprise when, going out onto one, I hit it perfectly at the moment when the sun was just leaving the horizon line with its lower part.\n\nAt that moment, my day automatically became better. The view of the valley bathed in fog, against the mountains, from behind which a fiery ball emerges, casting light in my direction - this is something I could wake up to every day.\n\nI'm very happy that I got here at this time, because today is Saturday, and on this day there are very many tourists here. It was very intimate.\n\nAfter a moment of forgetting and fully surrendering to the moment, I started descending towards the Czech border.\n\nOn the way, I reached the Błędne Skały. Due to the fact that I have a large backpack stuffed with equipment with me, I didn't decide to take the main route. However, there was something special there that I don't remember at all from when I was here last time. They created an alternative route for strollers, which is a simplified version of the main labyrinth for people who can't go there. They also built a huge shelter, which in size resembles a mountain hut. Things have changed a bit since my last visit.\n\nDescending from Błędne Skały, I leave the Stołowe Mountains, passing through the town of Pstrążnia. This is a small and very atmospheric town that has a lot of historical character. When I leave it, I also leave the country's border. I won't return to Poland for another four days.\n\nA few kilometers beyond the border, another important thing happens. Roughly when I enter Hronov, I cross exactly halfway on the trail here, which means that from now on I'm only closer than further from the finish, and it's no longer worth it for me to turn back.\n\nI got lost as I'm used to in such cities. Only here I have my justification, because there are four red trails, each going in a different direction, and I simply chose the wrong direction, but the right color. At least thanks to this I stopped by the spa park, where I could fill my entire bottle with delicious water that smells like rotten eggs. I think some minerals will come in handy, especially since I certainly smell worse than that water.\n\nFurther on, I'm heading towards the Žaltman peak. Meanwhile, passing through Czech forests. Fortunately, because it's cloudless and heat is pouring from the sky. The sun is burning me strongly from early morning today. It's good that while walking I can hide behind tree crowns, which provide invaluable shade. Thanks to this, you can catch your breath a bit. I also have to watch my water, because in such conditions you use significantly more of it.\n\nThe road to the peak itself is long but pleasant, because it leads along a comfortable forest track, next to which there are huge coniferous trees, which gives the effect of walking through a narrow tunnel.\n\nI reach the Žaltman peak itself at 14:00. I didn't expect such an observation tower. It's very tall and narrow, but enclosed, something like an improved version of the tower on Kłodzka Góra. There are quite a lot of tourists, and the road here encourages everyone. Especially on such a beautiful Saturday. There are cycling enthusiasts here, as well as those who prefer trekking. I even passed several couples with strollers.\n\nI thought there would be a jam and queues at the peak, fortunately I hit a quiet moment when there was almost no one.\n\nIt's incredible what views you can see here today. And I'm complaining that it's too hot, that there could be a bit more shade. After all, at such a moment it suddenly doesn't matter at all. Now it's perfect, windless, cloudless, you can simply see all the peaks like from a picture.\n\nUnfortunately, I have to descend, and I could spend the whole day here enjoying these views. Main goal of the day achieved, now I'm waiting to reach today's section finish. However, I hope I'll pass some city, because the supplies I made yesterday are slowly running out. I need more and more energy every day, so I definitely need to eat more. And today I felt I didn't do this properly.\n\nI have to watch out for this, because in such heat you can quickly miss the moment when it will be too late and your energy will be cut off.\n\nFurther on, a road to the border awaited me. I had to conquer a quite demanding peak there, Janský vrch. It took some strength from me, but I managed to do it relatively without problems. Now just a descent to a nearby town, where there's a store and I can finally do some shopping.\n\nOnly I didn't anticipate one thing. Today is Saturday. The store is already dark, and I only have a bit of food that has to last me until tomorrow.\n\nI'll have to try to buy some food from someone - that's the first thing that came to mind.\n\nWhen I was about to approach the next mountain, I suddenly saw some couple talking on the porch. I approached and described the whole situation. I wanted to buy some food, but she said she doesn't want money and brought me so much goods that it should easily last me until tomorrow, if I manage it well. A weight immediately lifted from my heart. It's wonderful that there are still such people in the world who are able to understand you practically without words. They saved my day with this gesture. I hugged them, warning that I stink, and headed to the shelter where I plan to spend the night.\n\nActually, I would never have thought that I would be in a situation where I would have to ask strangers for food. This is a very interesting lesson for me.\n\nA steep, final section of the trail still awaited me. Energized by their kindness, despite the kilometers in my legs, I walked very dynamically. At 21:40, I finally reached the cabin where I always wanted to sleep. Last year it was occupied. This year I'm afraid it will be too, after all it's Saturday and people spend time in the mountains. I approach and grab the handle. No one's there. I breathed a sigh of relief and with joy started packing inside. It's a house like from a fairy tale, and the attic looks just like in pictures from childhood."

        "content": "Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the solitude for long at night. A moment after I fell asleep, some cyclist arrived. Good thing I warned him, because downstairs the conditions are much worse, and I could sleep comfortably upstairs and at the same time fulfill my dream. It's just a shame that for the next hour he was getting ready to sleep and was so loud that I couldn't fall asleep. I have so little sleep that this time will definitely affect today's energy.\n\nI set the alarm for 1:45 because I want to stop by the mountain hut and take advantage of its amenities. First of all, I want to wash myself and charge all my equipment and do laundry. However, to fit all of this into the schedule, I had to subtract from sleep and leave as much earlier as it will take.\n\nSo I packed quickly and left the cabin heading towards the mountain hut at Okraj Pass.\n\nAs soon as I left, I saw a sky covered with stars. This is the most beautiful night view you can imagine. Impeccable sky covered with a million small points. Moreover, the moon shines so brightly that I don't have to use my headlamp at certain moments. Such weather now promises that on Śnieżka there should also be ideal weather conditions today. When there's clear sky there, it's wonderful news, because the views in the Giant Mountains are incredible. First, however, I need to reach the pass and take care of everything.\n\nWhile walking, my headlamp suddenly ran out. At the worst possible moment, because spare batteries are somewhere at the bottom of my backpack and I don't feel like taking them out. Classically in such situations, I'll walk with the phone flashlight. This is my longest section in the dark that I planned to cover, not counting the start, and of course at this moment something had to go wrong.\n\nJust before 5:00, I reached the mountain hut. I quickly plugged in the equipment to charge and went to wash.\n\nAfter the bath, I immediately felt much better, as if I had gained several times more energy. This really helped me. I also washed a T-shirt, which I directly put on myself to dry.\n\nLater, I went to repack a bit and check the state of supplies for today. I made myself sandwiches from the products I got yesterday, and it should easily be enough.\n\nI also met a local, with whom I chatted for a while about local tourism, and he also told me that on Sunday stores in the Czech Republic should be open. Only question is whether I'll hit any at the right time.\n\nExactly at 6:00, I gathered my things and set off on the scenic route to Śnieżka.\n\nAfter a half-hour ascent, I reach Skalny Stół, from where I can now see Śnieżka beautifully displayed against the blue sky, illuminated by still pristine rays of the sun. Now I'm heading directly towards it.\n\nI report to the summit just before 9:00. I won't be higher on this journey. I walked the entire route alone. I thought there would be crowds on Sunday, in such weather, but maybe people haven't started climbing yet. I'll see on the way down - then there will probably be more of them.\n\nOn the mountain, incredible views, mainly because the clarity of the sky has been consistently maintained for several days. There's not a single cloud, but the wind pleasantly cools the body tired from the ascent.\n\nAfter a few minutes, I start descending, heading towards Harrachov. After descending from the summit, I pick up speed walking along Równia. I pass a stream that gives me incredible cooling in such weather. There's no point counting on any shade here, so cold water worked wonderfully in this case. I also replenished the supply in my water bottle.\n\nFinally, I start a laborious and long passage along a descent section. People going in the opposite direction look at me with hatred.\n\nPassing through yet another town along the way, going through the center, I saw a store. I looked at the door - open. I was in great shock, and at the same time happy. I went inside and shopped for supplies. Finally, I don't have to worry that I'll be walking hungry.\n\nI sat down on a bench in the park and ate a lot, which definitely filled my stomach to satisfaction. Finally, I'm full and ready for further journey. Especially since Śnieżka finished me off today and I have very little energy left.\n\nAt 13:00, I ate everything and head towards Harrachov.\n\nUp on the mountain, you couldn't feel it as much, because there was that treacherous wind, but it's 30 degrees and it's become terribly hot. I started feeling on my face that I got sunburned, even though I didn't take this into account at all earlier. I smeared myself with sunscreen and continue on.\n\nAt 17:30, I finally reach Harrachov. I pass through here along the main street through the entire city, but it looks like some deserted place. Few cars, even fewer people - I thought this place was bustling with life. Moreover, many restaurants are open, but no one is sitting at the tables. It's a sad sight and I feel quite strange here. I quickly leave this city without stopping anywhere even for a moment.\n\nSuddenly, already on the way out, I noticed a spring, and next to it was a reservoir and benches. I poured myself fresh, cold water and went to a bench to soak my feet there. The water was so cold that at first I felt great relief, but when I held them there for several minutes, my feet had had enough. This was a great treatment for such overworked parts of the body. Slightly refreshed, I continued on the further route.\n\nIt's already 19:20, and I still have ten kilometers left. This is a very poor result and I'll probably go to sleep the latest on this expedition. Now a strong ascent to Mount Hvězda awaits me, where there's an observation tower.\n\nI reached there an hour later. I was counting on maybe seeing the sunset there, but in the evening the sky instantly covered with clouds. It looks like some precipitation is coming. After such a cloudless day, this is quite a surprise.\n\nThe tower itself was unfortunately closed, but it's certainly worth seeing. Its historical atmosphere and unusualness for modern towers gives exactly such a feeling. Certainly one of the prettier ones I've seen in my life.\n\nNow just under five kilometers to Tanvald, from where I'll start the final, extremely demanding ascent to the shelter where I want to spend the night.\n\nIn the distance, I start hearing thunder. The entire sky covered with dark clouds. After a short time, it started drizzling.\n\nIn my head, I only had one thing - to make it to my shelter. Finally, only at 22:30, I managed this feat and I can count the day as very demanding, but successful.\n\nI spread a tarp on the table and lay my sleeping bag on it. This was a very long day, so a moment after entering it, I fall asleep."

        "content": "This was a hard night for me after that extremely long and demanding previous day. I fell asleep with the phone in my hand writing reports and only woke up at 1:30. Fortunately, I woke up at all, because I could at least finish writing. Unfortunately, I didn't have much time left for sleep, because at 3:00 all alarms ring and you have to get up.\n\nReluctantly, I dragged myself out of the sleeping bag and started packing. At 3:40, I leave the accommodation.\n\nIt probably didn't rain at night anymore, but a moment after I set off, when I was still wandering in the darkness, it started pouring. This drastically reduced my visibility, which caused moments of doubt. Exposed sections with rocks became very slippery and dangerous at this time, fortunately I overcame them relatively calmly. After about half an hour of walking, I reached a twin shelter to the one I had just left. I was supposed to sleep in this one, but I'd had enough for yesterday. The distance between them is small enough that I could afford this.\n\nThe rain was falling the whole time, and I was already completely soaked. Moreover, now a short section through grass awaits me, where I'll be able to completely soak my socks - after a moment, that's exactly what happens. My travel comfort is now at a low level, I'll have to watch my feet for a long time.\n\nToday, besides various minor peaks, my main goal is Mount Ještěd.\n\nMoreover, all day I must successively head towards Germany, where I'll spend the night today, and tomorrow morning I plan to conquer the peak there.\n\nThe morning weather is nasty - it's raining, and moreover, you can't see much through the fog. Fortunately, it's not very cold - at least for now.\n\nAfter a series of days with beautiful views, everything indicates that this streak has just ended.\n\nI'm very happy that the weather held out yesterday and I didn't have to walk through the Giant Mountains like now. Today I'm wandering mainly through forests anyway, so it doesn't really matter to me, but yesterday I would have missed such beautiful views.\n\nSince it started raining, which was around 4:00 in the morning, it's now 10:00 and it's been pouring continuously.\n\nI'm walking completely frozen, soaked, and hungry. I don't even have anywhere to stop for a break. Everything everywhere is wet, and if I stop, I'll immediately get even colder.\n\nNot to mention the shoes and socks, which are completely wet, and it's not even worth drying them, because it will be the same again soon. I'm afraid to even think about how my feet feel and look now.\n\nI'm walking the initial section through small villages and surrounding forests. Before 11:00, I reach some elevation from where there are no views. Everything is bathed in clouds. But from here I'm closer to the main goal I'm heading towards.\n\nAfter 13:00, it finally stopped raining. After almost ten hours, I'll be able to dry off a bit. My hands look like I'm ninety years old, they're so waterlogged. It's also hard for me to bend them in the fingers.\n\nI hope that's the end of the rain, the sun will come out soon and everything will dry a bit.\n\nAt 14:00, I reach below the summit of Mount Ještěd. Unfortunately, from here I can see that it's bathed in cloud - literally just its tip. I won't see any views from it, unless in the few minutes it takes me to get there, the sky clears a bit. In such cases, it's a real lottery. You can see nothing, and five minutes later practically everything.\n\nIn my case, it was half and half. Honestly, climbing the mountain, I was convinced I would see absolutely nothing, but the clouds cleared a bit and you could see really quite a few interesting views. As you can see, sometimes it pays to take a risk, although I would have had to go up there anyway. Additionally, the building on the mountaintop in its construction reminds me of the one on Mount Praděd, maybe because there was a similar weather atmosphere there and I also saw it as if from behind fog.\n\nThe next section was extremely demanding. After conquering the main goal, a series of only slightly lower mountains awaited me, which were set one after another. Ascent, descent, and immediately the next ascent, and so five times. For a moment, I felt like I was on a roller coaster, only one powered by the strength of my own legs.\n\nA moment later, I passed by a shelter with a spring. I took advantage of this and hydrated myself fully. I also took water for supplies and washed my worn socks.\n\nNow the passage across the German border and setting up camp there awaits me.\n\nThe sky cleared up in the evening. Everything returned to normal, tomorrow promises to be a beautiful day. At 21:00, I cross the border and head to my shelter, where I want to spend the night. I should be there in 40 minutes.\n\nWhen I arrived, someone was already sitting by the shelter. It turned out to be a German cyclist who wants to spend the night here.\n\nFortunately, there are two benches, so we'll fit comfortably. Unfortunately, he warns me that he snores very loudly. I hope I don't lose sleep because of him.\n\nHe also saw my sleeping bag and I think he felt sorry for me, so he gave me one sleeping pad. I don't really know why he had two. I won't complain, I'm very happy about this, that I have it soft underneath.\n\nWe chatted for about twenty minutes and I already had to go to sleep. It's very late, and I want to get enough sleep before tomorrow. Because tomorrow will also be another exceptional day."

        "title": "Peace",
        "content": "The night was definitely one of the most peaceful I experienced on this expedition. Simply, when I went to sleep, after a few hours the alarm woke me. This may indicate that I'm already tired enough that the body draws from every possible opportunity for regeneration with full hands. I didn't even hear the mythical snoring of my companion, which was supposedly going to significantly bother my sleep. I'm very happy about this, because I got up extremely rested. I packed everything I needed, threw in something small to eat, and simply went on.\n\nMy goal today, which is ten kilometers from the start, is Mount Luž.\n\nYesterday, still being on the Czech side, I saw from a distance how it presents itself together with the observation tower that's there.\n\nFirst, however, I pass through the still sleeping atmospheric town of Oybin. It has a wonderful rock formation displayed against the background of the town center - it suddenly rises in such an impressive way that it had an enormous effect on me at this time, still in the dark.\n\nThe morning weather is good. There's a cloudless sky, the sun is waking to life, I hear how the forest is slowly waking up. Finally, the first rays of the sun break through the trees, you can hear bird songs, and above all the silence except for the tapping of my trekking poles.\n\nAt 5:40, I reached the place where I can use my backpack trick.\n\nThis is where there's a three-kilometer detour to the peak. So I have no choice but to throw it in the bushes and head towards the westernmost peak.\n\nI reach the summit at 6:40. There's a small observation tower here, as well as a terrace built into the ground infrastructure. There's no one here, it's a very intimate atmosphere. I like this place for the peace that reigns here. The sky is ready for such moments today and makes the views from here truly enchanting.\n\nSomehow I feel different here, knowing that this is my first peak conquered in Germany. This adds extra emotions. I admire the panorama visible from the terrace, admiring the area from every side. Everywhere you can see something interesting - mountains, forests, cities. Looking in each direction gives a completely different image. I feasted on this moment a bit and start descending to the place where I left my backpack. I should eat something from the leftovers I have, and then hunt for some store.\n\nFurther on, the road leads me along a pleasant forest path to the town of Hrádek nad Nisou.\n\nThis is where I'll be saying goodbye to Germany. It was a very short adventure, but it resulted in conquering one peak.\n\nBefore I leave it for good, however, one more surprise awaits me. In the trail plan, there's a detour to the tri-border point. First, I'll head to this place.\n\nThis is a symbolic point, because in one place there are all three countries that are part of this project. It illustrates the community and unity along the trail.\n\nAt noon, I leave German lands and return to the Czech Republic again. This is already the beginning of goodbyes. Not long ago, Germany wasn't even in sight of this journey, and now I already have it behind me.\n\nAfter about an hour of walking, I reach the town of Hrádek nad Nisou. This is where I plan to put my plan into action. First, I look for some good place where I can leave my phone to charge. A flower shop near the market square seemed ideal. I went in, and there I was surprised by two Korean women with whom I couldn't communicate. Finally, one called her boyfriend and we managed to arrange everything. I left my phone there and went shopping.\n\nNear the market square, there was a store, so there I supplied myself with all necessary products.\n\nThen I found a comfortable place near the store and sat down to replenish calories. Yesterday I didn't eat a main meal at all, so this one did me very good. I'm not afraid now that I'll lose energy for the second part of the day.\n\nAs soon as I finished consumption, I went to pick up my phone and continued the further journey towards the Jizera Mountains.\n\nNow, after leaving the city, I pass through several villages to finally rise to fields where the views are indescribable. Vast spaces surrounded by mountains that I conquered not long ago. All of this harmonizes perfectly with today's weather. On the meadows, it's incredibly idyllic, here time seems to have stopped. In the grass, you can hear crickets, and you feel the rays of the setting sun on your neck.\n\nWhen I passed by one of the shelters, there was a bicycle station next to it. Right in the middle of nowhere. Solar-powered for servicing electric bicycles. I noticed that there's a possibility to connect a regular outlet. So I checked if it works, and as it turned out, my phone was charging normally. I never paid attention to such amenities anywhere, but after this story, I'll always take this into account.\n\nFor me, a shelter itself is already no small luxury, and one with electricity, or even a stream nearby, is already pure luxury - something like a five-star hotel.\n\nAt the end, a bit of a fight with the Oldřichovský Špičák peak awaits me. Finally, it turned out to be won, but at the beginning I lost the trail and got lost. I had to return to the trail by compass, fortunately I managed somehow.\n\nAfter conquering the peak, there was also a lot of fun with rock formations here. You have to brace yourself a bit, or you need to slide through, or descend on some special steps. Moreover, there's a whole educational trail, where there were many places where the youngest can discover forest mysteries of nature.\n\nAdditionally, there was also a spring there, thanks to which I could replenish my meager water supply. I also washed myself a bit and was ready for further walking.\n\nOnly after 21:00 did I descend from there, and I still have four kilometers to a mysterious place where I plan to spend the night. I don't know what to expect, and I'm especially afraid that when I get there, it will be so dark that it will be hard to figure something out.\n\nOnly a few minutes before 22:00, I reach a field before the forest, where there's a well covered with a concrete cover. I unpack my things and slip under the roof. Here, fortunately, there's a bit more space. I get ready to sleep and enter my sleeping bag. I'm very curious about this night, because I have quite a few doubts."

        "content": "I slept quite poorly today. The place was uncomfortable, there was little of it, and I had some underlying anxiety in me all night. Generally, I don't recommend a well as accommodation.\n\nWhen I woke up, I saw a field all in fog. Yesterday I lost practically all the elevation to get here. The first thing I had in my head was that I should have camped on the mountain. It would have been warmer and dry there. After a moment, I checked my sleeping bag to see if it was soaked, fortunately it wasn't, because the place where I slept was fortunately located in a corner by a grove.\n\nIt turned out that two rivers converge at this place, which is why it was very humid and thus cold. I didn't really have much room to move after squeezing into the narrow gap that the well provided under its roof.\n\nFortunately, I somehow survived the night and can start another day of my adventure.\n\nPacking also wasn't among the most pleasant, because the grass all around was completely wet, so I avoided contact with it. I had to manage on a really small surface.\n\nFinally, I happily managed this feat and at 3:30 I set off on the route.\n\nAt first, still in the dark, I wandered among fogs and fields. The glow of the moon illuminated my path and gave an incredible character to this moment. It was cold, which my hands especially felt.\n\nAfter a few kilometers, I enter the city of Hejnice. It's quite large, so it takes me some time to pass through it completely lengthwise. I like walking through such towns before dawn. It's so empty and quiet, completely different than usual. After leaving this place, I'm heading towards my goal, which is Mount Smrk. I have to climb to this highest point of the Jizera Mountains.\n\nDirectly to the summit leads a steep and demanding ascent. After conquering it, I'm already on top. I leave my backpack on a bench at the bottom of the observation tower and go up myself. I look around the area, looking for points that are already well known to me from this expedition. Visibility is excellent, so I have no problem with this.\n\nAfter a moment, I descend and take a short break to eat breakfast. I eat everything I have, because I had small supplies and now I'll go hungry until the next store, which will only be in the afternoon.\n\nAfter a moment of rest, I put my equipment on my back and just before 8:00 I pass the Polish border. This is already the last time on this trail. To the end, a Polish section and all the peaks already well known to me remain.\n\nI'm now heading towards Hala Izerska.\n\nJust before it, I finally found a stream with quite easy access. I couldn't not take advantage of this and immediately stopped. I washed myself completely and soaked my feet for a moment. I held them longer in the icy water so they would regenerate a bit. Besides this, I also washed my socks, so they would dry during the day today. After I also brushed my teeth, I got up and went towards the hall.\n\nAnd when I reached it, I fell into rapture again. In such weather, it's simply enchanting. This full peace and idyll that reign here. Whenever I'm here, I have the impression that time has stopped.\n\nAfter a momentary contemplation, I must continue on towards Wysoka Kopa, and later to Wysoki Kamień.\n\nWhen I had already conquered these two peaks, it was after 14:00.\n\nMy stomach started rumbling very strongly. I'm already so very hungry, and to Piechowice it's still seven kilometers. This will be a very hard stretch, but when I get to the store, I'll buy out all the products.\n\nBefore I descended to the city, I lost all the hard-earned elevation. Literally, I had the impression that you couldn't go any lower. When I was there after 16:00, I saw a store, to which I joyfully went. I managed to chat with the store manager so that in the back she would charge my phone while I was shopping here. I did my shopping and ate it behind the store. What great relief I felt when something went into my stomach. I was so very hungry.\n\nI ate my fill and wanted to pour water into my water bottle. When I took it out, it turned out to be completely covered in mold. And I drank from it today. I hope I won't have any stomach problems because of this. Immediately when I saw this, I threw it in the trash. Now I'll have to figure out some other water system, because I only have one bottle.\n\nAfter 17:00, full and energetic, I continued on the further route.\n\nAfter a slight recovery of elevation, I reach a rock formation complex. There's a ladder here that leads to their summit. I willingly took on this challenge and went to the very top. From here spreads an excellent view of the entire Giant Mountains, showing their diversity and shape. An hour later, walking through fields, the same view of the Giant Mountains appears before me on literally the entire horizon line - it looks unbelievable.\n\nLately, I'm falling behind schedule. The final few days are chasing and arriving at the last moment, almost after dark. This is probably due to fatigue - one more break comes that makes a difference.\n\nToday was the same. To Wrzeszczyńskie Lake, I still had eleven kilometers, and it was already 19:30. I started pushing myself, sneaking through fields and forests. I didn't have a specific place, because there's no shelter here. I had to simply choose some convenient place on the ground. Unfortunately, everywhere was steep or muddy.\n\nI searched and searched further and further until the forest ended and I landed in Siedlęcin already after 22:00. I had planned to use a football field, but passing by I saw a playground. I know this is very unethical, but I'll disappear from here at 3:00 anyway, so I shouldn't bother anyone.\n\nSo I set up between the ladders and the slide, where there's almost sufficient space for the length of my body.\n\nI have comfort here ensured by the fact that I'm separated by barriers. Thanks to this, no one should see me.\n\nThere's nothing left for me but to finally enter my sleeping bag and go to sleep."

        "content": "The night on the playground was quite pleasant. The temperature at this place was good, and despite the lighting that was on all the time, it didn't bother me too much. I was curled up in my sleeping bag so much that I only saw darkness anyway. Although thanks to this, I had easier packing in the morning. I also noticed that the barriers are all covered in dew, I made a mistake here, because I didn't put everything in the backpack for the night, but nothing major happened.\n\nIn the morning, when I got up at 3:00, there were no kids on the playground yet, so I quickly packed up before they arrive and set off on the route.\n\nToday, two main peaks on the list to check off await me, but more on that later. Now I'm heading towards Okole and start traversing villages to get closer to this mountain.\n\nWhat an absurdity. At one point, being in the area of Chrościcka Pass, suddenly the trail seemed to have ended. This is a paradox, because the signs on the trees clearly indicated that it leads this way. It looks like I got lost while being on it the whole time. This section was impassable, completely blocked with trees and tall thickets. I started forcing my way through this terrain. Step by step, log by log, I managed to get out of this forest. I lost a lot of time, and my calves are all scarred from thorny bushes, burned by nettles reaching up to my armpits, not to mention my shoes, because my socks are completely soaked. It was going so peacefully and sleepily until now, and here suddenly I have a wake-up call.\n\nNearby, a river was flowing. So I decided to take advantage of this and step into the water with my feet. I washed them of all the dirt that was on them, and also immediately washed those already wet socks, changing to fresh ones. Immediately my morale lifted a bit.\n\nNot for long, because a moment later I came across a section of trail that was fenced off by a local farmer. As if it simply disappeared. I had to force my way through the grass again to get to the summit.\n\nGenerally, this section is terribly neglected. Signs on trees are faded, or there aren't any at all. As if someone abandoned this place.\n\nI reached the very mountain before 9:00. I decided to take a break here, and at the same time eat the first half of my halva cake without candles, i.e., ordinary halva cut in half. It so happens that today is my birthday. I couldn't have dreamed of a better present than such an expedition.\n\nWhen I got up in the morning, the sky was divided almost equally by a line into a part covered with a layer of clouds and a cloudless part. The second one no longer exists now, additionally it's lightly windy and quite cool. Such weather doesn't bother me - perfect for conquering forest peaks.\n\nAround 11:00, the sun came out from behind the clouds and it started clearing up. Instantly here in the Kaczawskie Mountains, this has an impact on the entire perception of these regions. Suddenly everything that's here opened up, spaces appeared, light added a lot of color to the hues that reign here. From a boring and dead place, finally something here stirred to such an extent that you want to explore.\n\nAt 13:00, I reach Skopiec. Before that, however, I need to replenish water shortages in the village below. Today I probably won't see a store, and even if I do, it will probably be closed - after all, it's Corpus Christi and everyone has the right to rest. I have to rely on local residents.\n\nThe gentleman willingly filled my bottle to the very top and told me a bit about this place. Specifically, it's about the fact that the trail currently passes right through his field, and people litter a lot. I agreed with him, referring to what I see in some shelters after weekends.\n\nOn the mountain, I took a short break. A mass of people passes through here, the parking lot is about ten minutes at the foot of the mountain. People conquer this peak like an assembly line.\n\nI sat down and ate sandwiches, additionally I need to regenerate my feet, because despite the sun coming out, my shoes are still wet and I quickly want them to dry.\n\nI also ate the second half of my halva cake - this time pretending to blow out candles, and continued on.\n\nNow, to achieve my next goal, I need to get to the Rudawy Janowickie area. When I get there, I'll want to conquer their highest peak, which is Skalnik. First, however, I need to pass a dozen or so kilometer section to Janowice Wielkie, where I'm counting on an open store.\n\nAlong the way, when I pass a river, I can't resist and take a quick break to soak my feet and wash my socks. And in this way, after the morning excesses, there's no trace left. Everything clean and dry.\n\nI reach the city at 17:00, but unfortunately the store is dark. I need to at least get water, so I go into a restaurant across the street and without a problem the owner fills my bottle from behind the bar.\n\nI couldn't be more ready than this, so I head towards the mountains. A quarter past 17:00, I enter the Rudawski Landscape Park.\n\nI lost all elevation entering Janowice Wielkie, and now climbing Skalnik, I have to make it all up again, and then some.\n\nA moment after 20:00, I reach the summit. I'm in the middle of the forest, so there's not much to do here. I just collect a stamp and fly a bit further to Ostra Mała, where there's a rocky viewing terrace.\n\nIt was definitely worth detouring to this point. It's located exactly on the side of the sunset, when it was already low above the horizon. The clarity of the sky added uniqueness at this moment. Magical views of the area with the assistance of fading rays.\n\nTime to descend and leave the Rudawy Janowickie. I'm heading towards Kamienna Góra, where I plan to spend the night.\n\nAlready after dark, I sneak through suburban fields. It's dark when I reach a small grove. With a flashlight, I try to locate any place where I can lay out my sleeping bag.\n\nFinally, I found one right by the road, but I need to organize some cut branches a bit to fit. After a moment, I'm already lying in my sleeping bag, exhausted, but ready for another day."

        "content": "Yesterday I finished walking very late. It was already well past 22:00 and it got dark. I lay down and I don't even remember when I fell asleep while writing reports. I woke up at 2:00, noticing the phone lying on the ground. This meant I had to finish writing. Fortunately, it was still before the alarm.\n\nAnd when it rang, I couldn't pull myself together to get out of the sleeping bag. I felt it was chilly, and moreover, I didn't feel like getting up.\n\nFinally, I made the only right decision and started packing. I ate the rest of the provisions. Currently, besides a liter of water, I have nothing. After a few moments, I was ready to set off, leaving my poor campsite.\n\nToday promises to be another beautiful day, the sky is cloudless, you can still see a crescent moon. The chill that reigns in the field again causes me discomfort while walking. I'm heading towards Kamienna Góra, where unfortunately everything will still be closed. Only when visiting the next town will I be able to stop by a store.\n\nAfter twelve kilometers of walking between fields and forests, I reach the town of Czarny Bór. This is a strategic place for me, because, as I mentioned earlier, there's a store here. Finally, I can make up for yesterday's evening hunger. I eat my fill here, also ensuring products for the rest of the day.\n\nFull of energy, I head towards the first goal on the map today, which is Chełmiec.\n\nThe Wałbrzyskie and Kamienne Mountains are a quite specific and demanding region on the Polish map of the Sudetes. Here it's teeming with conical mountain formations, which significantly affect the number of elevation gains. Leading a trail well here, you can really give yourself a hard time.\n\nThe idea of this trail is not just rigidly checking off the highest peaks, but also, as far as possible, getting to know these new ones. And this is exactly the case here, where additional, and at the same time exhausting, peaks are added to conquer.\n\nActually, before I conquer Chełmiec, I had to climb Boreczna, and then Mniszek. The second one is unfortunate in that it's really a steep wall up and in a moment a steep wall down - end of fun. On top, there's also a lot of grass up to your waist, which makes it a tick breeding ground. I pulled at least thirty off myself, fortunately none attached. This is all thanks to the fact that I regularly check myself.\n\nPrecisely because this section is so characterized by elevation gains, and this is already the very end of the journey, I was terribly afraid of this day. I hope I'll manage today, and there won't be ruins left of me.\n\nI climbed Chełmiec a dozen or so minutes after 10:00. I spent about half an hour here, because I had a few things to take care of. I had to collect a stamp, and then go up the observation tower. I've been to Chełmiec several times, but I've never been on this tower. It was always either closed, or there were no viewing conditions.\n\nThis time they were fantastic, which was confirmed only at the top. A wonderful view of the area, and even those further mountain ranges, immediately put a smile on my face.\n\nI still had to rest for a moment on the summit. There were a lot of people, so I didn't experience mental peace, only physical.\n\nFinally, I started descending from the mountain with a very steep and unpleasant descent, where I had to watch every step so as not to fall. Finally, I managed this feat, although it wasn't easy.\n\nNext, the route passed through Wałbrzych. Here it's impossible to resist the multitude of stores. So I decided to stop for a short break and load up on a bit more calories.\n\nWhen I had eaten everything, I started ascending the Wałbrzyskie Mountains, rising above the city.\n\nWhen I took a break to take off my sweatshirt, suddenly someone caught up with me and tapped me on the shoulder. It turned out to be my acquaintance Marcin, who lives in the area and decided to take advantage of the fact that you can see my track on the map, so he started tracking me.\n\nI was very happy to see a guest who decided to dedicate his time to walk with me for a while.\n\nI really appreciate such gestures, and despite how symbolic this was, it really lifted my morale and motivation.\n\nTogether we climbed the mountains above Wałbrzych, I pass through Niedźwiadki and finish at Wołowce. Meanwhile, we talked a lot about his recent mountain expeditions, and I also told him quite a few interesting facts about this project.\n\nIncidentally, he brought me a Snickers and gummies. Such gifts in such moments taste the best. They gave a huge boost for further journey.\n\nBesides this, Marcin carried my liter of water for a while, and also charged my phone to the max with his power bank. Now I don't have to worry about batteries at all.\n\nUnfortunately, all good things come to an end quickly, and as I mentioned earlier, at Wołowce we unfortunately had to part.\n\nI started descending a very sharp slope covered with stones, where you had to watch every step that could end in a fall. Very slowly, but safely, I managed to descend from this mountain, but now an almost vertical ascent to Borowa awaited me. Like a wall, it rose before me, so I started climbing. After a dozen or so minutes of really hard ascent, I managed to see the observation tower on the summit.\n\nI left my backpack at the bottom and went to admire the views.\n\nThese turned out to be, as with all in recent days, reliable. The weather additionally strengthened the contrast to the greenery that reigned all around. At the end, I also cast a glance towards the Kamienne Mountains, which I'm about to head to. I sat for a few more minutes on the mountain and started descending towards the Andrzejówka mountain hut.\n\nJust before 19:00, I reach the mountain hut. I leave the power bank here to charge and my backpack. I'm doing this because a very steep ascent to Waligóra now awaits me. I immediately head towards it. After just under a quarter of a very demanding climb, I'm on the summit. There's not much here besides satisfaction. So I start walking the same route back. However, going this way is much harder for me. Stones slide under the weight of my body. Finally, I reach the end and with relief head to pick up my things.\n\nI also took advantage of the situation to brush my teeth and add a bit of water.\n\nNow I'm fully ready for the further route. However, I'm heading towards yet another mountain, counting on catching the last sunset.\n\nUnfortunately, I only reach there at 21:00, so I was a dozen or so minutes late. However, I can still see the golden aura above the mountain line.\n\nIt's already very late, so it's time to descend and head to the place where I'll spend the night, and I still have over ten kilometers there.\n\nAs I said at the very beginning, I knew this would be a very demanding day, so I'm prepared to go to sleep very late. However, this is already the very end, and my legs already feel the toil of the entire expedition so much that I had to make some compromises with myself.\n\nA quarter before midnight, I reach Marcowa Pass. There's a large shelter here with adapted bunks for sleeping. The building itself from the outside doesn't impress, but inside it has everything you need.\n\nNext to the cabin, a campfire is still smoldering, I decided to take advantage of this and heat up a roll before sleep. I haven't eaten anything warm in a long time.\n\nFull, I lie down in my bed. This will be my last night on this journey and at the same time the shortest."

        "content": "When I entered the sleeping bag, I don't even remember when I fell asleep, I also don't know if I managed to position myself well, it was so quick.\n\nThe alarm that woke me today was set a bit later, at 3:45. This is because I have a slightly shorter distance to cover. Or rather I'd say that you can't walk any more - the trail has to end sometime. Moreover, I have a quite late train home, so I could afford this to make it on time.\n\nI slept so well that I could spend much more time here, but I know what consequences that would have, so I started packing. Packing the sleeping bag went especially reluctantly. A quarter past 4:00, I left Marcowa Pass.\n\nI start the walk with an ascent to the Włodarz summit, from which unfortunately there are no views. A shame, because I was there right during sunrise, which hid somewhere behind the trees. However, the entire orange-red color of the sky was breaking through between them.\n\nNext, I set my direction to the first goal. First, I descend to the town of Walim, to feel the morning freshness of the town there. When I had completely lost elevation, it's time to climb to the summit. I first approach Mała, to conquer Wielka Sowa a moment after 7:00.\n\nOn the mountain, you can already admire the renovated observation tower, which was out of use for several good years.\n\nSo I thought that today maybe I'll be able to use it, unfortunately it was closed and I couldn't get inside.\n\nI sat for a moment to catch my breath. I ate breakfast and was ready to set off towards the last peak on the trail.\n\nIt's incredible that today it will simply end like this. So many hours, enormous ascents, a mass of sacrifices just to stand in this place. To now be at the finish and appreciate the toil and path you walked to find yourself here.\n\nNow, to reach the Ślęża massif, I need to cover about thirty kilometers. First, I still need to descend from the current elevation, and then walking through villages, finally conquer the last artifact of this project.\n\nUnfortunately, my water is running out, and to the nearest village it's still a ways. I'll have to make do somehow.\n\nI can already see the Ślęża massif in the distance with the characteristic transmission tower on the summit. With each step, I'm getting closer to this place.\n\nI'm walking along flat terrain at noon. Around me are only fields and no trees. Heat is pouring from the sky, on which there's not a single cloud. Sometimes a light wind blows, which provides a bit of relief.\n\nIn the distance, I see Sudeten foothills that stretch all the way to Ślęża peak rising above them, which against their background seems colossal.\n\nSomewhere roughly in the middle of my route today, I reached the village of Mościenice. It so happened that this is the only store on the route that I'll pass today. I couldn't waste such an opportunity. However, I didn't have to buy anything for supplies. I only took those things that I planned to consume immediately in front of the store. These were standardly cottage cheese, bananas, and some roll, everything I finished off with a handful of nuts at the end. Full and energized, I continued on towards the ultimate goal.\n\nNow, unfortunately, another dozen or so kilometers of fields in full sun await me. This section is unbearable because of this. I feel so tired, as if my head hurts - this is definitely the effects of dehydration. I try to drink as much as I can, but in such conditions even this isn't enough.\n\nA plus is the abundance of cherry trees that occur here. I often pass some abundantly covered with fruit. I pick a few and while marching, snack on them one after another.\n\nFinally, I enter the forest. Finally, a bit of shade, instantly I feel relief, immediately I walk better.\n\nI reach Tąpadła Pass at 17:30. This is my official moment of starting the ascent to Ślęża.\n\nI have four hours left until the train and about ten kilometers of route.\n\nI feel that I need a moment of rest, so I stop here for a moment. My legs aren't carrying me as well as I'd like.\n\nFinally, I set off. At the beginning, I pass crowds of people who came to this area.\n\nHowever, turning after a moment onto an alternative trail, suddenly from the noise it became silence and peace - this is an extraordinary phenomenon.\n\nFrom this moment, I begin the final ascent. There won't be any more of them on this trail. This is the last one I have on the list.\n\nThis final ascent is quite demanding and will stay in memory longer. It leads me over rocks to the Olbrzymki viewpoint. Unfortunately, nothing is visible from this place now, because everything has been overgrown with trees. I need to climb even higher to see anything.\n\nExactly at 19:00, I finally climb this last peak and thus complete the full list of conquered peaks on this trail.\n\nThis is a quite specific observation tower with a ladder that strikes fear into the eyes of more than one tourist. I couldn't resist and went up to admire the views, which still against the background of the sun radiating above the horizon looked majestic. However, I realize that this was the last view on this expedition, and with sadness I start leaving this place.\n\nI have two hours left for the descent. However, the trail sign shows that it should take me an hour and a half. I'm very happy about this, because it means I'll definitely make it. Moreover, the sign with the inscription PKP Sobótka, i.e., the place where the trail ends, awakens no small emotions in me.\n\nI concluded that this trail is the pure definition of me. Every day that I planned, I realized scrupulously. This wasn't chance - pure consequence.\n\nDespite the difficulties of a given stage's fate, I knew what I had to do most importantly to fulfill the goal. There was no way out.\n\nEverything else was a result of variables over which I had no influence. You simply have to come to terms with this. You also have to be able to deal with such variability. And this is precisely what builds true character in a person - certainty that in every, even the worst situation, you're able to find yourself and come out of it unscathed. And there were already several such situations. Thanks to them, I'll certainly become a stronger person.\n\nA quarter before 21:00, I descend to Sobótka.\n\nHere I just need to pass through the city to get to the PKP train station, where my return train will arrive at the same time, and also where there's a dot marking the end of the trail.\n\nI reach it, ending another stage in my life. This was an incredible journey, a wonderful adventure, there will be time for summaries later."
